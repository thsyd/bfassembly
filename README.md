## Abstract
Bacteroides fragilis is an opportunistic pathogen that resides in the human gut as part of the human commensal flora. Short DNA sequencing alone is unable to resolve the structure of the genome. Very few complete genome assemblies have been deposited to public databases, and none are clinical multidrug resistant isolates (2019-02-2018). To add to the public databases and to explore the location of antimicrobial resistance genes in the context of the complex genomes of B. fragilis, we aimed to complete genome assembly using a hybrid assembly approach. Using the Sanger sequenced Bacteroides fragilis NCTC 9343 (=ATCC25285) (NCBI RefSeq (accession GCF_000025985.1) (as a comparative reference, we
